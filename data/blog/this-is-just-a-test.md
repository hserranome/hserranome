# Just trying Astro collections

This is actually pretty cool and easy to use. Also, I was using the 4.0 version of Astro and updating it was so so easy.

I remember the Gatsby days. Man, that was really a horrible introduction to GraphQL.

Now, I would like to have Obsidian like links on these blogs, so I can just upload notes of stuff I see around and have them like a public knowledge base for me, friends, and chismosos.
