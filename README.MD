# Hey, nice to meet you! 👋

I'm Hendy Serrano, a full-stack developer specialized in JavaScript. In love with Typescript, React and Strapi. Can do both front end and back end. Flutter is cool too. Self taught.

Worked on multiple projects as a solo developer as well as running and directing projects with small development teams. I've been able to build cool stuff in a variety of industries and startups, ranging from a dating site to an IoT app.
