# Hey, nice to meet you! 👋

My name is Hendy Serrano, I am a 23-year-old full-stack developer who has been in the field for over 4 years (almost 5 now). I've worked on multiple projects from start to finish as a solo developer as well as leading small teams, and my experience has given me many different opportunities to build cool stuff in a variety of industries (from a dating site to a diamond marketplace to an IoT app). I've been messing around with computers since I was 11 years old, and working as a developer for almost 5 years. I'm a **JavaScript** specialist with project management skills, and now I'm totally in love with **Typescript**, **React**, and **Flutter**. I'm a big fan of **Strapi** too.
