# Hey, nice to meet you! 👋

I'm Hendy Serrano, a 23-year-old full-stack developer with over 4 years of professional experience. 

Specialized in JavaScript. In love with Typescript, React and Strapi. Can do both front end and back end. Flutter is cool too.

Self taught. I've been into tech since I was a child, and I started learning programming when I was 16 years old.

Worked on multiple projects as a solo developer as well as running and directing projects with small development teams. I've been able to build cool stuff in a variety of industries and startups, ranging from a dating site to an IoT app.
